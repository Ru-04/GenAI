Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond politely. Since they didn't ask a question, I should just greet them back and offer help. Keep it friendly and open-ended. Maybe say something like "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That's simple and invites them to ask anything. Make sure the tone is warm and approachable. No need for any technical jargon here. Just a straightforward, welcoming response.
